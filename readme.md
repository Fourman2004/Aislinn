# Aislinn
A game made by Daydream Studios at Falmouth University

## Game
Aislinn always knew she would take over for her father one day, but that day is sooner than she thought.

Aislinn is an adventure/exploration platformer following the Sandman's daughter as she ventures to find her missing father. Traverse the dreamscape and find where he could have disappeared to - but be careful. With dreams, there's always a chance of a nightmare showing up.
